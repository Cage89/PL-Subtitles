Go on, write it down.

17 - 9 = 8

00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:44.754 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Good. Your mother wrote
her 8s the same way.

00:01:52.542 --> 00:01:53.692 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Daniel!

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.123 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I'm not going as far as I thought.
Only to Denmark.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.161 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'll write to you.

00:02:11.877 --> 00:02:14.937 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It's not an internal matter
for the school any more.

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:17.311 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Let's go through the names.

00:02:17.792 --> 00:02:19.915 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Łubin.
- Fairly obvious.

00:02:20.292 --> 00:02:21.496 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Who was he?

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.318 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
A Prime Minister. Caught making out
with a custodian last year.

00:02:25.403 --> 00:02:27.637 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
That's even worse.
We can transfer him.

00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:30.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Kamiński has three failing grades,
also obvious.

00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:32.831 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- How about Długosz?
- Who was he?

00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:34.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Minister of Health.
- He's a half-orphan.

00:02:35.042 --> 00:02:38.165 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Great grades, exemplary
behavior.

00:02:39.337 --> 00:02:41.860 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Has leadership skills
but everybody likes him.

00:02:57.082 --> 00:02:58.383 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Fuck her!

00:03:00.185 --> 00:03:01.411 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Fuck her!

00:03:46.957 --> 00:03:48.239 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What's wrong?

00:03:49.707 --> 00:03:51.646 line:85% position:50% size:80%
She used to be my teacher.

00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:54.080 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I hated her.

00:03:57.167 --> 00:03:59.697 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You've never noticed
me before, have you?

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.283 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You'd get skates or a bike but
I never liked your good grades.

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.068 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You knew that, didn't you?

00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:17.156 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You know what made
me really happy?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.305 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You beating up a teacher
when you were thirteen.

00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.355 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Nothing but straight Cs
after that.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.836 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I never liked overachievers.
Especially in life.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.795 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And that included your school.

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:34.490 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You're still here?

00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:40.915 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Kasia, this is my son.

00:04:45.583 --> 00:04:46.728 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Witek.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.083 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- The room is only ours for an hour.
- I have to make a call.

00:05:19.875 --> 00:05:22.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You always call and
never say a thing.

00:05:26.416 --> 00:05:29.786 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Witek? Is that you?
- Yes.

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:32.827 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Yes, Dad.

00:05:32.913 --> 00:05:35.706 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
They're taking me
to the hospital. Kasia's here.

00:05:35.791 --> 00:05:38.815 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
In case I don't see you...
You don't have to do anything.

00:05:38.901 --> 00:05:40.802 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Do what?
- Nothing at all.

00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:42.084 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Dad!

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.415 line:85% position:50% size:80%
My father.

00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:56.654 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Pissing or puking?

00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:04.153 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You're lucky.

00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.113 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- You lost your vocation?
- That's right.

00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:23.802 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And?

00:06:26.583 --> 00:06:29.812 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
My late father
wanted me to be a doctor.

00:06:30.038 --> 00:06:33.190 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
But on his deathbed he told me
he didn't want it anymore.

00:06:33.276 --> 00:06:35.459 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I need some time to think.

00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:40.889 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Of course. Though it's a pity.
- You've got milk whiskers, sir.

00:06:42.952 --> 00:06:48.245 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
<i>The train to Warsaw East Station
</i><i>will depart from Platform 2.</i>

00:06:58.333 --> 00:06:59.331 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Are you blind?

00:06:59.416 --> 00:07:02.158 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- You'll break your neck!
- Sorry.

00:07:02.791 --> 00:07:04.697 line:85% position:50% size:80%
He spilled all my change...

00:07:20.865 --> 00:07:22.180 line:85% position:50% size:80%
A beer, please.

00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.576 line:85% position:50% size:80%
A student ticket to Warsaw.

00:07:39.213 --> 00:07:40.331 line:85% position:50% size:80%
One to Łomża.

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:31.074 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You were lucky.

00:08:31.894 --> 00:08:34.687 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- You could've missed it.
- Yeah. I almost have.

00:08:43.417 --> 00:08:45.106 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Feet off the seat!

00:08:45.207 --> 00:08:48.268 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- May I go to the restroom?
- Go.

00:08:52.625 --> 00:08:54.677 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Don't get lost on the way.

00:09:22.707 --> 00:09:25.976 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Scram. It's your chance.

00:09:27.332 --> 00:09:29.126 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'll give you my sneakers.

00:09:55.875 --> 00:09:57.399 line:85% position:50% size:80%
He wouldn't run?

00:09:59.582 --> 00:10:00.711 line:85% position:50% size:80%
No.

00:10:03.471 --> 00:10:07.916 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Sometimes people don't run.
Because they don't want to.

00:10:10.542 --> 00:10:14.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Repeated beatings
on the shinbone

00:10:15.582 --> 00:10:18.408 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
leave you with
a permanent limp.

00:10:44.875 --> 00:10:48.754 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It used to taste better...
I pleaded guilty at the trial.

00:10:49.875 --> 00:10:56.789 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
But it took me time to realize
that standing for my ideals

00:10:56.875 --> 00:11:04.677 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
meant admitting to
things I've never done or thought.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:17.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
And Krystyna was waiting...
for freedom.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.873 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Did I tell you what she was like?
- You did.

00:11:21.957 --> 00:11:24.224 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Everything about her was pale.

00:11:24.375 --> 00:11:26.866 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Somewhat peculiar for a woman

00:11:27.582 --> 00:11:35.913 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
who had some fair fuzz above her
upper lip and near her ears.

00:11:36.625 --> 00:11:38.450 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And large, ugly hands.

00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Maybe that was why I touched her.
Because of her imperfections.

00:11:47.299 --> 00:11:54.138 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
She couldn't take her ring
off those fat fingers...

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.211 line:85% position:50% size:80%
When Adam was arrested in 1949.

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:10.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Back then, in 1949,
it meant that he was a spy.

00:12:10.707 --> 00:12:12.998 line:85% position:50% size:80%
He wasn't, but who cared?

00:12:13.082 --> 00:12:15.980 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It took me a year
to convince her.

00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:21.586 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And so, I've moved in with her.

00:12:26.792 --> 00:12:30.592 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- We called already?
- Yes. No answer.

00:12:32.542 --> 00:12:33.886 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And now?

00:12:34.957 --> 00:12:38.835 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I still believe, but do they?

00:12:40.957 --> 00:12:44.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
When they arrested me
and I pleaded guilty

00:12:44.582 --> 00:12:50.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
she started to doubt whether
she was married to a spy.

00:12:51.832 --> 00:12:54.140 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Even though
I convinced her she was.

00:12:54.225 --> 00:12:56.291 line:85% position:50% size:80%
That's why she couldn't believe

00:12:56.375 --> 00:13:00.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
that I also was against
the Party and Communism.

00:13:00.707 --> 00:13:06.595 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
She stopped believing the Party.
She only believed herself.

00:13:07.582 --> 00:13:09.740 line:85% position:50% size:80%
We were in the same prison.

00:13:11.125 --> 00:13:13.405 line:85% position:50% size:80%
She would visit both of us.

00:13:16.667 --> 00:13:18.428 line:85% position:50% size:80%
We walked past one another...

00:13:21.042 --> 00:13:26.344 line:85% position:50% size:80%
She was even whiter and paler then

00:13:29.207 --> 00:13:33.166 line:85% position:50% size:80%
and had that fuzz above her lip.

00:13:38.566 --> 00:13:43.182 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Dial. 45-21-95.

00:13:56.207 --> 00:13:58.177 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Hello?
- Ask for Krystyna.

00:13:58.292 --> 00:14:01.067 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It's a public phone,
hence the poor connection.

00:14:01.153 --> 00:14:03.413 line:85% position:50% size:80%
May I talk to Krystyna, please?

00:14:05.082 --> 00:14:08.904 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Say you're from the Institute.

00:14:09.167 --> 00:14:11.248 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'm from the Institute.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.652 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Hello, it's me. Krystyna?

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.475 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I came back a few hours ago.

00:14:24.667 --> 00:14:26.451 line:85% position:50% size:80%
But you weren't there...

00:14:30.417 --> 00:14:33.201 line:85% position:50% size:80%
<i>No trouble sleeping lately?</i>

00:14:38.346 --> 00:14:39.456 line:85% position:50% size:80%
<i>What?</i>

00:14:42.875 --> 00:14:43.975 line:85% position:50% size:80%
<i>Hania?</i>

00:14:47.682 --> 00:14:49.110 line:85% position:50% size:80%
<i>You're a grandmother?</i>

00:15:39.125 --> 00:15:43.479 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I was away for a few days
and I'm leaving again soon

00:15:43.565 --> 00:15:46.418 line:85% position:50% size:80%
so I haven't done any shopping.

00:15:59.082 --> 00:16:02.028 line:85% position:50% size:80%
No, I can't eat at this hour.

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Well?
- Have I shown you her picture?

00:16:11.082 --> 00:16:13.081 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I haven't and I won't.

00:16:13.167 --> 00:16:15.480 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I hope you meet her some day.

00:16:15.832 --> 00:16:19.451 line:85% position:50% size:80%
This picture is thirty years old,

00:16:20.457 --> 00:16:27.783 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
and I don't want you to have
too specific ideas about those times.

00:16:29.332 --> 00:16:31.232 line:85% position:50% size:80%
When did you get out?

00:16:32.207 --> 00:16:36.841 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Not soon enough. They started
releasing spies in 1954.

00:16:37.688 --> 00:16:43.932 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Us, the "dissenters", were
kept longer.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:59.831 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
By the time I got out,
they'd been together for over a year.

00:17:00.707 --> 00:17:02.020 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And you?

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:11.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I was given this apartment, and
moved in... For good, I suppose.

00:17:13.041 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
And here is where
you believe in all that?

00:17:16.375 --> 00:17:19.556 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Here... and anywhere else.

00:17:20.375 --> 00:17:26.631 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Maybe being here
makes it easier to believe.

00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:35.512 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'm sort of... more equal here.

00:17:37.375 --> 00:17:44.046 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Mind you, after prison I never
wanted to be less equal.

00:17:45.166 --> 00:17:47.538 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Not that I didn't get
tempting offers.

00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:55.386 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Some of my fellow inmates
had a lot to offer.

00:17:55.625 --> 00:17:58.481 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
But you can see
what's happening to all that.

00:18:00.583 --> 00:18:02.196 line:85% position:50% size:80%
It's very simple.

00:18:02.458 --> 00:18:11.451 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
If we didn't manage to do it,
maybe this generation will.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.451 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You, for instance.

00:18:19.791 --> 00:18:22.297 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Want a blanket?
- Yes, please.

00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:33.128 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Go to bed. I'll stay up
a little longer.

00:18:34.208 --> 00:18:39.050 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
There is another
blanket on the bed.

00:18:39.458 --> 00:18:42.227 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I have several blankets...

00:18:59.291 --> 00:19:05.539 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
My father died ten days ago.
I didn't make it to his bedside.

00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:12.205 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
But I got his final message:
there's nothing I have to do.

00:19:31.125 --> 00:19:32.342 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Witek! Come here.

00:19:37.083 --> 00:19:40.167 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- This is Mr. Długosz.
- What's he doing?

00:19:40.604 --> 00:19:44.192 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Fourth year of medical school,
currently on Dean's leave.

00:19:44.665 --> 00:19:46.746 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Second thoughts about
becoming a doctor?

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.063 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Yes.

00:19:48.416 --> 00:19:51.284 line:85% position:50% size:80%
So, now we know everything.

00:19:52.166 --> 00:19:54.050 line:85% position:50% size:80%
See if we can get started.

00:19:59.583 --> 00:20:01.915 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Have you read this?
- Yes.

00:20:02.173 --> 00:20:03.481 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Any comments?

00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:07.309 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I agree with what you write.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.611 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You write well.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.758 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It's pretty much all
that you do well.

00:20:14.125 --> 00:20:15.887 line:85% position:50% size:80%
We're ready for you.

00:20:20.458 --> 00:20:22.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- You want to listen?
- I'd love to.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.867 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Werner is leaving in three weeks.
- And for a long time.

00:20:33.625 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Should you need anything,
let me know.

00:20:46.666 --> 00:20:51.351 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I know exactly what I want to say.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.758 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I don't need notes.

00:20:54.375 --> 00:20:59.663 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I wish to present my current views

00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:08.349 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
on the concept
I've adhered to for forty years.

00:21:09.708 --> 00:21:15.355 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Each generation desires
some kind of light;

00:21:16.458 --> 00:21:19.253 line:85% position:50% size:80%
needs assurance and faith

00:21:20.083 --> 00:21:25.143 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
that the world can be just
and better organized.

00:21:27.083 --> 00:21:33.740 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
This desire, older than Marx
and younger than Marx,

00:21:34.333 --> 00:21:36.571 line:85% position:50% size:80%
is like a drug.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.748 line:85% position:50% size:80%
At the beginning, it brings joy

00:21:40.833 --> 00:21:44.689 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
because the light
seems within reach.

00:21:45.541 --> 00:21:48.416 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Towards the end,
it brings bitterness

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.140 line:85% position:50% size:80%
as you realize it's drifted far away.

00:21:53.617 --> 00:21:56.442 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I've been through a lot
in those last forty years.

00:21:56.528 --> 00:22:00.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
And now, the light is much
more distant than it's ever been.

00:22:00.093 --> 00:22:05.657 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I shouldn't encourage you
to take this road but trust me,

00:22:06.416 --> 00:22:09.854 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
without that bitterness,
without that hope

00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:13.667 line:85% position:50% size:80%
life would be pathetic.

00:22:26.958 --> 00:22:32.644 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Relax. She's short-sighted
and doesn't wear glasses.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.736 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Wait a second.
- Sure.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.993 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Chili? Chili!

00:22:56.125 --> 00:22:57.637 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You don't recognize me?

00:22:59.958 --> 00:23:01.061 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Hi.

00:23:02.416 --> 00:23:04.117 line:85% position:50% size:80%
May I kiss your hand?

00:23:08.833 --> 00:23:09.968 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Witek!

00:23:11.125 --> 00:23:12.792 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Can we talk?
- Sure.

00:23:16.666 --> 00:23:17.950 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Will you wait?

00:23:21.416 --> 00:23:22.586 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Who is he?

00:23:23.708 --> 00:23:26.250 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
My first love.
I'll be right back.

00:23:40.291 --> 00:23:43.718 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Goodbye then. Remember to
switch off the gas.

00:23:46.208 --> 00:23:47.401 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Wait...

00:23:49.416 --> 00:23:55.381 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Adam gave me his card.
In case I needed anything...

00:23:56.458 --> 00:23:59.173 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- So?
- I'm not sure what to do.

00:24:00.791 --> 00:24:02.212 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Do as you please.

00:25:26.916 --> 00:25:28.506 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Applying for a passport?

00:25:30.333 --> 00:25:32.138 line:85% position:50% size:80%
No. For Party membership.

00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:46.596 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Pity we didn't sleep together
when we were seventeen.

00:26:11.083 --> 00:26:14.051 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Farmer? There is Stanisławski.

00:26:14.708 --> 00:26:16.403 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Sportsman Jacek Wszoła.

00:26:17.778 --> 00:26:20.069 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Zimerman, of course!

00:26:21.166 --> 00:26:24.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Engineer? I'm not sure.
It says "mechanic" here.

00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:29.565 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Buzek. Yes, I'll double-check.
Idziak and Buzek.

00:26:33.541 --> 00:26:34.676 line:85% position:50% size:80%
May I?

00:26:40.708 --> 00:26:44.470 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Excuse me, there's a problem
with the list of young Poles...

00:26:45.161 --> 00:26:47.582 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- They're asking who these are.
- Close the door.

00:26:47.666 --> 00:26:49.076 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Who is he?
- Witek.

00:26:49.458 --> 00:26:52.477 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Please sit down, Witek.
Join us.

00:26:56.583 --> 00:27:01.762 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
We have a problem. There is
a riot in one of our detox centers.

00:27:03.375 --> 00:27:06.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- I don't follow.
- Junkies. Grass, acid...

00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:07.508 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Drug addicts.

00:27:08.833 --> 00:27:10.910 line:85% position:50% size:80%
We took them under our wing.

00:27:11.219 --> 00:27:15.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Restaffed the centre with
young doctors and nurses.

00:27:15.291 --> 00:27:18.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
But they say they don't want
the young ones.

00:27:18.916 --> 00:27:21.166 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And threaten to set the place on fire.

00:27:22.875 --> 00:27:26.791 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
The simplest way would be
to call the police but...

00:27:27.583 --> 00:27:29.202 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Someone has to go there.

00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:33.583 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You know what I think?
Do you?

00:27:37.083 --> 00:27:40.838 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
He can go!
What do you say, Witek?

00:27:42.458 --> 00:27:45.221 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
He was the one in
the green jacket!

00:27:47.368 --> 00:27:48.740 line:85% position:50% size:80%
We can't go.

00:27:49.083 --> 00:27:52.587 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
We're very unpopular there
and we could only make things worse.

00:27:52.673 --> 00:27:54.690 line:85% position:50% size:80%
But you... Give it a try.

00:27:54.818 --> 00:27:59.402 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Comrade Adam spoke well of him,
didn't he?

00:27:59.958 --> 00:28:02.457 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Would you do it?
- I can go...

00:28:02.541 --> 00:28:05.074 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
But what should I do
when I get there?

00:28:07.083 --> 00:28:08.252 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Calm them down.

00:28:08.337 --> 00:28:10.664 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Do whatever it takes
to calm them down.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:14.634 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
We'll be here, by the phone.
Keep the line open.

00:28:14.875 --> 00:28:17.484 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- He'll need a car.
- What about the list?

00:28:20.508 --> 00:28:21.583 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What list?

00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:25.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Who are Buzek and Idziak?
- Look them up, will you?

00:28:26.208 --> 00:28:30.051 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Idziak is a film director,
Buzek, an aircraft engineer.

00:28:30.625 --> 00:28:34.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Well then, put on your jacket.
You'll be there in an hour.

00:28:36.791 --> 00:28:37.939 line:85% position:50% size:80%
He'll do it!

00:28:44.958 --> 00:28:48.060 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Our men are on stand-by.
- OK. I'm going.

00:28:52.625 --> 00:28:55.397 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Who is it?
- From the Warsaw Council.

00:28:56.291 --> 00:28:57.429 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Your ID.

00:29:13.166 --> 00:29:14.449 line:85% position:50% size:80%
From Warsaw.

00:29:36.333 --> 00:29:38.031 line:85% position:50% size:80%
We've met before.

00:29:39.791 --> 00:29:42.138 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Długosz. The Warsaw Council.
- Hi.

00:29:44.083 --> 00:29:47.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- We have ten of those.
- It'll all burn down in ten minutes.

00:29:47.958 --> 00:29:50.057 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Warsaw area code?
- 8.

00:29:57.416 --> 00:29:59.528 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Like in America, isn't it?

00:30:04.375 --> 00:30:06.008 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Długosz speaking.
I'm here.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:11.307 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
The doctors are here.
Locked up.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.519 line:85% position:50% size:80%
No, I just got here.

00:30:15.291 --> 00:30:17.672 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Looks like the director's office.

00:30:18.375 --> 00:30:19.474 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Bye.

00:30:20.291 --> 00:30:22.157 line:85% position:50% size:80%
It's the counselor's office.

00:30:23.625 --> 00:30:28.286 line:85% position:50% size:80%
The director's office is much nicer.

00:30:29.541 --> 00:30:30.711 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Isn't it?

00:30:33.118 --> 00:30:35.194 line:85% position:50% size:80%
He has a palm plant there!

00:30:36.916 --> 00:30:38.166 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Look, pal,

00:30:38.708 --> 00:30:42.539 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
since you guys took over, a girl
and two boys have pulled the plug.

00:30:42.625 --> 00:30:43.623 line:85% position:50% size:80%
They what?

00:30:43.708 --> 00:30:47.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Offed themselves. She with poison,
the other two hanged themselves.

00:30:49.208 --> 00:30:51.490 line:85% position:50% size:80%
One spent four days in this cage.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:53.578 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And before?

00:30:54.083 --> 00:30:55.207 line:85% position:50% size:80%
No one, ever.

00:30:55.291 --> 00:30:58.143 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- What are your demands?
- Can't you read?

00:31:00.028 --> 00:31:02.544 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Cancel the party's patronage,
bring back the old staff

00:31:02.628 --> 00:31:04.383 line:85% position:50% size:80%
and restore the hospital status.

00:31:04.468 --> 00:31:07.121 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- You're in charge?
- Yes. He's a doctor.

00:31:08.144 --> 00:31:09.332 line:85% position:50% size:80%
She's our therapist.

00:31:09.416 --> 00:31:12.248 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Where's the rest?
- Got away when it started.

00:31:12.333 --> 00:31:14.343 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Can I talk to them?
- Let him.

00:31:18.875 --> 00:31:22.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- I'm not sure what to do.
- Try to get us out of here.

00:31:22.917 --> 00:31:26.159 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Who was in charge before?
- Helpless suckers who wanted

00:31:26.243 --> 00:31:30.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
to treat addiction with persuasion
while drugs were being smuggled in.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:33.108 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- But there were no suicides.
- We saved one.

00:31:33.193 --> 00:31:36.457 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
And we were cleared
of any negligence with the other two.

00:31:36.541 --> 00:31:38.789 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Time's up!
- You think they would burn the place?

00:31:38.875 --> 00:31:41.855 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Sure. They're nuts.
These three and the rest!

00:31:42.625 --> 00:31:44.159 line:85% position:50% size:80%
We're not afraid.

00:31:52.708 --> 00:31:54.250 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Like in America?

00:31:56.833 --> 00:31:59.108 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Can you call a meeting?
- I can.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.769 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Roll calls in the morning,
then press reviews.

00:32:04.001 --> 00:32:07.582 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
They locked us up, read our letters
and searched our parcels.

00:32:07.666 --> 00:32:09.873 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Finally, they banned all visitors.

00:32:09.958 --> 00:32:11.435 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Gestapo!

00:32:12.791 --> 00:32:15.470 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
And they've made me
a group leader.

00:32:15.666 --> 00:32:18.250 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Do I look like a group leader?

00:32:19.333 --> 00:32:23.708 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I barely knew the old director,
but I thought he liked us.

00:32:24.208 --> 00:32:25.781 line:85% position:50% size:80%
He liked Staszek, too.

00:32:26.291 --> 00:32:28.319 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
They caged him
for making love to me.

00:32:28.404 --> 00:32:30.886 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Staszek was the one
who hanged himself.

00:32:34.666 --> 00:32:38.396 line:85% position:50% size:80%
<i>We're roaming the world</i>

00:32:39.083 --> 00:32:41.832 line:85% position:50% size:80%
<i>in search of a brand new life.</i>

00:32:41.916 --> 00:32:48.724 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
<i>We keep looking forward
</i><i>to yet another love.</i>

00:32:50.166 --> 00:32:53.873 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
<i>- We are different...</i><i>
</i><i>- A call for you.</i>

00:32:53.958 --> 00:32:57.323 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
<i>that's why you
</i><i>don't want to know us.</i>

00:32:57.791 --> 00:33:03.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
<i>We are different
</i><i>but capable of so much...</i>

00:33:06.916 --> 00:33:08.053 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Hello?

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.876 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Yeah, a meeting.

00:33:11.666 --> 00:33:12.964 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Hold on.

00:33:33.083 --> 00:33:34.402 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Jump!

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:41.849 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Hurry.

00:33:55.083 --> 00:33:57.481 line:85% position:50% size:80%
They got away! They ran!

00:33:57.958 --> 00:33:59.385 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Bring the fuel cans!

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:03.244 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Gasoline!

00:34:05.217 --> 00:34:07.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Everyone to the corridor!
Spill it! Quickly!

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.882 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Run! I'm staying.

00:34:09.791 --> 00:34:12.248 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Stop! Don't do it!
You got me!

00:34:12.333 --> 00:34:13.496 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Get him!

00:34:17.333 --> 00:34:19.539 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Bring the buckets and bowls!

00:34:19.625 --> 00:34:21.646 line:85% position:50% size:80%
It's too slow from the cans.

00:34:22.916 --> 00:34:24.650 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Use the bowls.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.043 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Lock it!

00:34:32.416 --> 00:34:34.065 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Did you hear?

00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:35.903 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What?

00:34:36.458 --> 00:34:39.380 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I stayed so they didn't
burn the place down!

00:34:39.541 --> 00:34:41.128 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Yes, three demands.

00:34:42.458 --> 00:34:44.427 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I think they're right!

00:34:45.791 --> 00:34:48.639 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
We're waiting till eight,
then we'll burn it all.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:10.331 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It's just water. To test
how it spills.

00:35:10.416 --> 00:35:11.518 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Relax.

00:35:25.416 --> 00:35:29.445 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You got off to a good start.
That moment of weakness helped.

00:35:29.625 --> 00:35:31.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- I was scared.
- I know.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:36.574 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
But you should know that
such moments can be useful.

00:35:37.666 --> 00:35:40.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Such a moment of weakness
makes you just like them.

00:35:41.416 --> 00:35:46.469 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
They drop their guard
and you gain the upper hand.

00:35:46.875 --> 00:35:49.043 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You shouldn't have said
they were right.

00:35:49.128 --> 00:35:50.358 line:85% position:50% size:80%
They were.

00:35:51.117 --> 00:35:53.164 line:85% position:50% size:80%
But why say that in front of them?

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:56.914 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
If better timed, the truth can serve
a purpose - add to your prestige,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.873 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- help obtain concessions...
- I wanted to play fair.

00:35:59.958 --> 00:36:02.532 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You were there in
an official capacity.

00:36:02.655 --> 00:36:06.045 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
If you were there as a private person,
you'd have acted differently.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.257 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Why?

00:36:07.666 --> 00:36:08.916 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I was alone.

00:36:09.375 --> 00:36:14.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
No. You had a phone, the police
and the authorities to fall back on.

00:36:14.958 --> 00:36:17.422 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Otherwise, you'd have
been scared.

00:36:19.875 --> 00:36:23.088 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Krystyna, this is Mr. Długosz.
- Hello.

00:36:27.541 --> 00:36:30.978 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Was it you who called us
last year, before Werner left?

00:36:31.132 --> 00:36:32.311 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Yes.

00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:36.315 line:85% position:50% size:80%
We used to be friends long ago...

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.806 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
He told me.
He told me many things.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- About prison?
- That too.

00:36:42.166 --> 00:36:46.213 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Had he been released first,
our lives would have gone differently.

00:36:46.297 --> 00:36:48.206 line:85% position:50% size:80%
He'd be here now.

00:36:48.291 --> 00:36:50.539 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You think it was blind chance?

00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:55.539 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
He was beaten into a false confession.
It's a matter of character.

00:36:55.625 --> 00:36:57.114 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I was beaten.

00:36:58.583 --> 00:37:07.153 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
But for the next fifteen years
I've exercised my legs.

00:37:08.125 --> 00:37:10.250 line:85% position:50% size:80%
He didn't have a purpose.

00:37:10.541 --> 00:37:15.110 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
How can one believe in something
that almost destroyed him?

00:37:16.416 --> 00:37:18.983 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Every idea has its period of errors.

00:37:19.541 --> 00:37:21.846 line:85% position:50% size:80%
The Inquisition did worse things,

00:37:22.416 --> 00:37:25.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
yet people died at the stake
having faith in God.

00:37:25.625 --> 00:37:28.748 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Then, John XXIII breathed new life
into the Church.

00:37:28.833 --> 00:37:32.039 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Are you sure this period
of errors won't happen again?

00:37:32.125 --> 00:37:33.456 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- In this country?
- Yes.

00:37:33.541 --> 00:37:41.574 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Am I sure? Right now,
in this country,

00:37:43.083 --> 00:37:45.326 line:85% position:50% size:80%
everything's falling apart.

00:37:46.666 --> 00:37:52.094 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Those who govern are helpless.

00:37:52.708 --> 00:37:54.862 line:85% position:50% size:80%
This system is doomed.

00:37:56.083 --> 00:37:57.706 line:85% position:50% size:80%
It's just a matter of time.

00:37:57.791 --> 00:37:59.590 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Is that what you think?

00:38:00.375 --> 00:38:03.534 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- And you say it?
- Out loud? Yes.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:04.989 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Why to me?

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:08.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Because those at
the top won't listen.

00:38:08.708 --> 00:38:11.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I need someone to back me up.
Maybe people like you?

00:38:12.041 --> 00:38:14.947 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- So what should be done?
- Adam!

00:38:16.893 --> 00:38:18.039 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Excuse me.

00:38:27.875 --> 00:38:29.003 line:85% position:50% size:80%
The scissors...

00:38:34.518 --> 00:38:37.280 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- What was I saying?
- I asked what should be done.

00:38:37.364 --> 00:38:39.483 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You have to be on the inside.

00:38:40.666 --> 00:38:43.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Nothing can be improved
from the outside.

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:45.490 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
When all of this
comes tumbling down

00:38:45.576 --> 00:38:47.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
someone has to be there
to pick up the pieces.

00:38:47.583 --> 00:38:48.686 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Who?

00:38:49.666 --> 00:38:51.878 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You, me... Someone.

00:38:53.625 --> 00:38:58.396 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
We can't leave this
country to them, can we?

00:38:59.791 --> 00:39:01.809 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You know what terrifies me?

00:39:02.208 --> 00:39:08.277 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Losing freedom. Being under
somebody's thumb.

00:39:10.625 --> 00:39:12.289 line:85% position:50% size:80%
This is an organization.

00:39:12.375 --> 00:39:16.282 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
With my position, nothing
I do will go unnoticed.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:18.789 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And I accept that.

00:39:20.375 --> 00:39:23.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I have no position to speak of
and yet you know

00:39:23.653 --> 00:39:27.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
what I said or didn't say
at that detox center.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.871 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Because you've made the first step.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.887 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Let's start all over again. Try.

00:39:50.666 --> 00:39:51.831 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What for?

00:39:53.291 --> 00:39:56.097 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I need to know everything about you.

00:39:57.583 --> 00:40:00.856 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
If we're to be together.
If we're to be at all...

00:40:00.958 --> 00:40:02.789 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Do you get it?
- I do.

00:40:02.875 --> 00:40:04.175 line:85% position:50% size:80%
So start talking!

00:40:05.958 --> 00:40:09.295 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
My first time was
with a guy at a scout camp.

00:40:09.541 --> 00:40:12.047 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I had my panties on.
Very uncomfortable.

00:40:12.333 --> 00:40:17.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
His pal next to us pretended to be
asleep and panted throughout.

00:40:19.125 --> 00:40:22.336 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I had to pull my tight panties aside

00:40:24.375 --> 00:40:27.666 line:85% position:50% size:80%
and ended up chafed.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.927 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Did it hurt?
- The chafing?

00:40:32.208 --> 00:40:33.307 line:85% position:50% size:80%
No.

00:40:33.708 --> 00:40:34.807 line:85% position:50% size:80%
It did.

00:40:36.166 --> 00:40:37.621 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I had three abortions.

00:40:38.152 --> 00:40:41.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Once, when I was in love.
Two others were accidents.

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:45.367 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
First one was done at the hospital.
It was disgusting.

00:40:45.708 --> 00:40:48.798 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
They shaved me.
Private doctors don't do that.

00:40:49.708 --> 00:40:51.407 line:85% position:50% size:80%
How many more guys?

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:53.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Exact number?
- Yeah.

00:40:54.208 --> 00:40:57.056 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Six. No, seven.

00:40:58.666 --> 00:41:00.539 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Including a one-night stand.

00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:02.206 line:85% position:50% size:80%
He bit me right here.

00:41:02.291 --> 00:41:04.079 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Where?
- Here.

00:41:05.541 --> 00:41:10.054 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
We had sex in a hotel.
In The European.

00:41:11.875 --> 00:41:14.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Where else?
With the others.

00:41:15.708 --> 00:41:20.461 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
In a bed, in a bathroom, once in
a car, once in a toilet...

00:41:53.208 --> 00:41:54.398 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I love you.

00:41:59.708 --> 00:42:00.974 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I love you, too.

00:42:09.458 --> 00:42:13.418 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I really wanted to find you
these past eighteen months.

00:42:15.416 --> 00:42:17.961 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I tried the dorm several times.

00:42:19.125 --> 00:42:24.110 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I would come to your door.
Always too afraid to ring the bell.

00:42:33.208 --> 00:42:34.697 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What's wrong, bosun?

00:42:34.923 --> 00:42:38.039 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
They just keep bringing more.
Two boats are already full.

00:42:38.125 --> 00:42:40.965 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- If there's a search...
- What then?

00:42:41.708 --> 00:42:43.577 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Nothing. Never mind.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.373 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
He's complaining that you're
stashing illegal prints here.

00:42:50.458 --> 00:42:52.965 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Have to stash them somewhere
until we can distribute them.

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:54.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- You have a lot?
- Quite a lot.

00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:56.173 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Who's that guy?

00:42:59.125 --> 00:43:00.452 line:85% position:50% size:80%
He's all right.

00:43:00.541 --> 00:43:01.717 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Witek!

00:43:07.458 --> 00:43:09.016 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:43:12.208 --> 00:43:14.940 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Shouldn't you keep these out of sight?

00:43:17.333 --> 00:43:18.496 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Brandys.

00:43:20.916 --> 00:43:22.898 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Konwicki. Have you read it?

00:43:25.083 --> 00:43:27.063 line:85% position:50% size:80%
"The Polish Complex"?

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.400 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You can buy it from him.

00:43:31.958 --> 00:43:34.108 line:85% position:50% size:80%
<i>What will our homeland be like?</i>

00:43:34.541 --> 00:43:37.481 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
<i>It'll be different - just,
</i><i>noble and wise.</i>

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:42.139 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
<i>A role model for all of Europe; risen
</i><i>from the blood of her best sons.</i>

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.581 line:85% position:50% size:80%
They distribute those themselves?

00:43:47.666 --> 00:43:51.615 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
No. We're taking them to Gdańsk,
Kraków or Szczecin.

00:43:51.916 --> 00:43:55.096 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
And local boys
distribute them there.

00:43:57.666 --> 00:43:59.182 line:85% position:50% size:80%
A helluva system.

00:44:09.541 --> 00:44:11.836 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- What are you doing here?
- I'm with a girl.

00:44:11.922 --> 00:44:13.032 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Chili!

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:20.869 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Look what I've bought.

00:44:23.606 --> 00:44:24.715 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Here?
- Yeah.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Funny that you have
your boat here.

00:44:27.375 --> 00:44:28.222 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Why?

00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:31.958 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
They keep those illegal books
a hundred yards from you.

00:44:32.791 --> 00:44:36.135 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Are they fine boys? How many of them?
- They're great. And quite a few.

00:44:36.221 --> 00:44:38.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
That's how I imagined scout
resistance during the war.

00:44:39.056 --> 00:44:40.539 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Well organized, nationwide.

00:44:40.625 --> 00:44:43.237 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Good to have the likes of them
on your side.

00:44:44.583 --> 00:44:47.025 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
They're the ones with black
neckerchiefs?

00:44:49.958 --> 00:44:51.525 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Is she in it too?

00:44:58.916 --> 00:45:01.077 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'm not asking for names.

00:45:03.166 --> 00:45:05.664 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It's just good to know
what's going on.

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:09.960 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
And to have our own sources
not just relying on someone else's.

00:45:10.333 --> 00:45:12.123 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Take this into consideration.

00:45:12.208 --> 00:45:14.760 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Meaning what?
- Just think about it.

00:45:16.791 --> 00:45:19.998 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Are you going to the meeting
with the French in July?

00:45:20.083 --> 00:45:22.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Probably. I don't know yet.
- When is Werner due back?

00:45:22.708 --> 00:45:23.818 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Soon, I think.

00:45:28.208 --> 00:45:29.396 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'll see you.

00:45:35.375 --> 00:45:37.235 line:85% position:50% size:80%
She'll be sailing the seas!

00:45:47.666 --> 00:45:51.152 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- What are you drinking?
- Vodka. I'm getting drunk.

00:45:56.666 --> 00:45:59.123 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Are you alive?
- Yeah.

00:45:59.583 --> 00:46:02.259 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- The Polish emblem?
- White Eagle.

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:07.581 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- When were you born?
- June 1956, in Poznań.

00:46:07.916 --> 00:46:09.498 line:85% position:50% size:80%
So was I, but in Łódź.

00:46:09.583 --> 00:46:12.920 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Tanks had just rolled onto
the streets.

00:46:13.291 --> 00:46:17.271 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Father worked at the riot-hit
plant, stayed there overnight.

00:46:17.833 --> 00:46:19.706 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Mother went into labor,

00:46:19.791 --> 00:46:22.378 line:85% position:50% size:80%
headed to the hospital,

00:46:23.708 --> 00:46:26.161 line:85% position:50% size:80%
gave birth to us and died.

00:46:26.458 --> 00:46:27.373 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Us?

00:46:27.458 --> 00:46:31.943 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Me and my brother. I'm alive
because I was born first.

00:46:35.666 --> 00:46:39.420 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I seem to remember that moment.

00:46:39.958 --> 00:46:43.262 line:85% position:50% size:80%
It's in my mind's eye.

00:46:57.416 --> 00:47:01.527 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- How intelligent!
- And bold! To talk publicly...

00:47:02.791 --> 00:47:06.226 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Speak of the devil. Your speech
was a real eye-opener.

00:47:06.416 --> 00:47:08.188 line:85% position:50% size:80%
That's what I wanted.

00:47:08.833 --> 00:47:10.038 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Very daring indeed.

00:47:12.416 --> 00:47:15.018 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Do you have a moment?
- Yes. Excuse me.

00:47:16.875 --> 00:47:20.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- It looks like you'll be elected.
- I don't know.

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:25.168 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It really matters
who you step aside with.

00:47:30.833 --> 00:47:34.914 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It'll take time to tell you all
about their political system.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.351 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Just look what they manufacture.

00:47:38.333 --> 00:47:42.202 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Press here and you get a calculator.

00:47:42.541 --> 00:47:46.940 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Here, and it shows you
time and date.

00:47:47.625 --> 00:47:53.775 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
And here is a stopwatch
accurate to one hundredth of a second.

00:47:55.541 --> 00:47:58.193 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Give it a try.
Push right here.

00:47:59.875 --> 00:48:04.393 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
See? Each number plays
its own musical note.

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:09.150 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Now try to set the alarm.

00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:18.088 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Ten tunes to choose from.

00:48:19.708 --> 00:48:22.364 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Tiny, but it does it all.

00:48:23.208 --> 00:48:26.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You're doing very well.
Getting promoted...

00:48:27.291 --> 00:48:30.887 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Yes. I'm on the Main Council.

00:48:32.916 --> 00:48:34.101 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What's that?

00:48:34.958 --> 00:48:36.523 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Go on, push it.

00:49:00.958 --> 00:49:02.230 line:85% position:50% size:80%
As if it died.

00:49:08.414 --> 00:49:10.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I didn't want to come to your place.
There is a problem...

00:49:10.851 --> 00:49:12.289 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Yeah. Werner is back.

00:49:12.375 --> 00:49:15.206 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It isn't that. We need a new
way to meet. I'll call you.

00:49:15.291 --> 00:49:16.268 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Why?

00:49:16.375 --> 00:49:19.664 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
They found the books,
arrested two of the boys,

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:22.719 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
took out the printing press...
All at once.

00:49:29.625 --> 00:49:32.150 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Ms. Olkowski?
Your ID, please.

00:49:33.833 --> 00:49:35.085 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Yours too.

00:49:43.875 --> 00:49:44.978 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Ah, it's you...

00:49:46.375 --> 00:49:48.365 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You come with me.

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:19.144 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Comrade Adam is busy now.

00:50:32.541 --> 00:50:34.668 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What's with you, motherfuckers?

00:50:34.753 --> 00:50:35.945 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Lost your hands?

00:50:44.625 --> 00:50:45.775 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You calmed down?

00:51:04.583 --> 00:51:06.190 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Do we call the police?

00:51:07.541 --> 00:51:10.250 line:85% position:50% size:80%
No. Kick the fucker out!

00:51:11.851 --> 00:51:14.143 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
And keep your mouths
shut about it!

00:51:28.166 --> 00:51:29.650 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'm moving out!

00:51:29.833 --> 00:51:33.036 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You showed me it's OK
to believe in something

00:51:33.168 --> 00:51:35.208 line:85% position:50% size:80%
and I trusted you like a fool!

00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:39.835 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
When I showed my Party Card
to my aunt,

00:51:40.416 --> 00:51:45.161 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
she said her life hadn't
been wasted, and wept.

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:51.039 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Screw her tears!
Screw your combatant stories!

00:51:51.125 --> 00:51:54.748 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
This idea is about you having
power and doing what you want!

00:51:54.833 --> 00:51:58.206 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- I haven't done anything for years.
- That's even worse.

00:51:58.291 --> 00:52:01.639 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
People get arrested everywhere.
Even women.

00:52:03.541 --> 00:52:06.972 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
That buddy of yours
made me a snitch.

00:52:10.791 --> 00:52:13.614 line:85% position:50% size:80%
That's why I messed up his face.

00:52:13.791 --> 00:52:16.786 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
With this hand,
I messed up his face.

00:52:16.958 --> 00:52:18.505 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I know.
He called me.

00:52:21.208 --> 00:52:22.322 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Wait.

00:52:24.791 --> 00:52:31.023 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You forgot your ticket to Paris.

00:53:26.833 --> 00:53:28.096 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Excuse me, Dean!

00:53:30.708 --> 00:53:32.653 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You'll lose your paper.

00:53:54.125 --> 00:53:55.293 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Chili!

00:53:56.666 --> 00:53:57.889 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Chili!

00:54:37.125 --> 00:54:39.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I answered all their questions
with "I don't know".

00:54:39.717 --> 00:54:41.581 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I don't know... I don't know...

00:54:41.666 --> 00:54:44.054 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Did they beat you?
- No.

00:54:44.666 --> 00:54:46.057 line:85% position:50% size:80%
The officer was handsome.

00:54:46.143 --> 00:54:49.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Fair hair, blue eyes, blue jeans.
He looked like...

00:54:51.416 --> 00:54:52.898 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Like that one!

00:55:02.958 --> 00:55:04.588 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'll be right back.

00:55:08.625 --> 00:55:11.056 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You got me out and came
for your reward?

00:55:11.708 --> 00:55:12.905 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Shall I strip?

00:55:14.416 --> 00:55:15.923 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I didn't get you out.

00:55:20.666 --> 00:55:24.521 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- I seem to have lost my bearings.
- You were to go to France.

00:55:27.041 --> 00:55:28.306 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I don't want to go.

00:55:29.375 --> 00:55:34.302 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Go. And when you come back, marry
a Politburo member's daughter.

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.815 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Call me when you
become a minister

00:55:38.166 --> 00:55:42.398 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
so I can spit in your face because now
I pity you too much for that.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.108 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Jesus...

00:56:05.333 --> 00:56:07.451 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Hi. Taking the globe along?

00:56:07.536 --> 00:56:10.023 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I've moved out and have
no place to store it.

00:56:10.108 --> 00:56:11.208 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Hi.

00:56:11.791 --> 00:56:14.664 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Have some room in your bag?

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:18.144 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Take this for me, will you?
But be careful. It's crystal.

00:56:18.432 --> 00:56:19.532 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Careful.

00:56:19.958 --> 00:56:21.057 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Hi.

00:56:24.628 --> 00:56:25.663 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'm Długosz.

00:56:25.748 --> 00:56:28.405 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- We've met before.
- At the detox center.

00:56:28.492 --> 00:56:32.112 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I'm grateful that you pulled me
out of that madhouse.

00:56:46.208 --> 00:56:50.492 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- What are we waiting for?
- The passports. Speak of the devil!

00:56:52.471 --> 00:56:54.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I have the passports
but there's a problem.

00:56:55.043 --> 00:56:56.565 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Strikes have begun...

00:56:56.650 --> 00:56:59.365 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%

The trip has been canceled.

You're needed out there.

00:57:18.458 --> 00:57:19.539 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Are you blind?

00:57:19.625 --> 00:57:22.561 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- You'll break your neck!
- Sorry.

00:57:22.958 --> 00:57:24.679 line:85% position:50% size:80%
He spilled my change...

00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:38.648 line:85% position:50% size:80%
A beer, please.

00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:48.242 line:85% position:50% size:80%
A student ticket to Warsaw.

00:57:52.447 --> 00:57:53.510 line:85% position:50% size:80%
One to Łomża.

00:58:27.333 --> 00:58:30.974 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Władek! Stop him!
Call the police!

00:58:44.708 --> 00:58:55.853 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
The only censored fragment
of the film lost beyond retrieval.

00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:04.442 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Name?
- Długosz. Witek Długosz.

00:59:04.791 --> 00:59:05.963 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Born?

00:59:06.048 --> 00:59:08.297 line:85% position:50% size:80%
June 27th, 1956. In Poznań.

00:59:09.625 --> 00:59:11.657 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Poznań?
- Yes.

00:59:12.875 --> 00:59:14.606 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You're a student?

00:59:14.833 --> 00:59:16.737 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Yes. On Dean's leave.

00:59:20.125 --> 00:59:22.414 line:85% position:50% size:80%
First, he got into a fight with me,

00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.726 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
then he beat a policeman
and tussled with my colleague.

00:59:26.916 --> 00:59:31.940 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
A week ago I caught him
urinating at the station.

00:59:32.958 --> 00:59:35.391 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I didn't report it,
but that was him.

00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:39.217 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Is that true?
- No.

00:59:42.250 --> 00:59:49.510 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
We find the defendant guilty
and sentence him to thirty days

00:59:49.958 --> 00:59:54.826 line:85% position:50% size:80%
of supervised community work.

00:59:55.875 --> 00:59:57.039 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Kiss my ass.

00:59:57.125 --> 00:59:58.780 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Pardon me?
- Nothing.

00:59:59.208 --> 01:00:02.804 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I hope the punishment will serve
its educational purpose.

01:01:14.791 --> 01:01:18.472 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
A railroad guard picked a fight
with me. And you?

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:20.818 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- The FU.
- What?

01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:23.442 line:85% position:50% size:80%
The Flying University.

01:01:23.708 --> 01:01:26.789 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I was making my apartment
available for lectures

01:01:26.875 --> 01:01:30.001 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
and a neighbor filed
a disturbance complaint.

01:01:31.458 --> 01:01:33.605 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What shall we do with this?

01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:38.195 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
We'll put it back. Maybe they'll
retrieve it from under the eagle.

01:01:41.541 --> 01:01:42.641 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I don't know.

01:01:43.875 --> 01:01:46.105 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%

01:02:01.125 --> 01:02:03.579 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Witek Długosz.
- No last names!

01:02:04.375 --> 01:02:05.530 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Why not?

01:02:06.541 --> 01:02:10.019 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Who told you all those things?
- My father.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.762 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Mine died two weeks ago.

01:02:16.208 --> 01:02:18.306 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I wasn't there.

01:02:20.416 --> 01:02:23.856 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
He told me over the phone
there was nothing I had to do.

01:02:24.251 --> 01:02:26.980 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Then he gave me the same
message through a doctor we knew.

01:02:27.065 --> 01:02:28.744 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What did you have to do?

01:02:29.666 --> 01:02:33.630 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
He wanted me to be
a decent man, a doctor.

01:02:35.416 --> 01:02:37.304 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I don't know what he meant.

01:02:38.583 --> 01:02:41.231 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'm told he didn't want to die.

01:02:42.583 --> 01:02:47.134 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Though he seemed
resigned to his fate.

01:03:01.791 --> 01:03:02.949 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Hi.

01:03:03.375 --> 01:03:06.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Meet Stefan.
- Witek Dłu... Witek!

01:03:07.666 --> 01:03:09.650 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- New?
- New and clean.

01:03:10.666 --> 01:03:11.844 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Here you go.

01:03:16.416 --> 01:03:18.923 line:85% position:50% size:80%
"The Worker" and other prints.

01:03:19.583 --> 01:03:23.219 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And 4000 for the books.

01:03:26.625 --> 01:03:30.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Try to get something by Burek,
about literature,

01:03:31.083 --> 01:03:35.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Górnicki's about the Church and Kowalik's
"Social System". Much sought after.

01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:38.155 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Seven in total. Give it
to the free unions.

01:03:41.708 --> 01:03:43.581 line:85% position:50% size:80%
The phone number's inside.

01:03:43.666 --> 01:03:46.585 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Couldn't he deliver it?

01:03:47.458 --> 01:03:49.117 line:85% position:50% size:80%
He could, for starters.

01:03:49.291 --> 01:03:52.181 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Sure. Call and what?
- Arrange to meet.

01:03:52.541 --> 01:03:55.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Do I mention you, father?
- Call me Stefan.

01:03:55.833 --> 01:03:57.222 line:85% position:50% size:80%
It's hard, damn it...

01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:06.797 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I was here a month ago.
I missed my train...

01:04:06.958 --> 01:04:09.483 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
If I hadn't, we wouldn't
have met.

01:04:10.458 --> 01:04:12.601 line:85% position:50% size:80%
It's not just blind chance.

01:04:13.041 --> 01:04:14.521 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Sometimes I think it is.

01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:53.905 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You forgot something, gentlemen?

01:04:54.916 --> 01:04:58.456 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
No. It's me.
I called yesterday.

01:05:07.791 --> 01:05:09.112 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What happened?

01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:16.327 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Did Stefan send you?
- The priest, yes. What happened?

01:05:17.958 --> 01:05:20.606 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Nothing happened.

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:31.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I have the money for you.
7,000.

01:05:32.708 --> 01:05:34.048 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Thank you.

01:05:34.291 --> 01:05:36.204 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I saw them... Bastards!

01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:41.476 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Well, it's not
really their fault.

01:05:41.706 --> 01:05:44.302 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It's not a big deal,
I'll clean up.

01:05:49.458 --> 01:05:51.596 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You've been with us long?

01:05:51.833 --> 01:05:53.108 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Not really.

01:05:54.125 --> 01:05:57.184 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- You didn't know such things happen?
- I didn't.

01:06:00.208 --> 01:06:01.570 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Don't be ashamed.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:04.643 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
No need to be. Everyone's
ashamed.

01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:09.188 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'll help you.

01:06:37.375 --> 01:06:39.137 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You dropped something.

01:06:42.625 --> 01:06:47.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- So, what happened?
- They brought flowers.

01:06:49.125 --> 01:06:51.387 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
On behalf of the
workers, they said.

01:06:53.041 --> 01:07:00.268 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Thanked me for helping those
who got fired or are oppressed.

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:03.956 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And for anti-government leaflets.

01:07:04.041 --> 01:07:06.755 line:85% position:50% size:80%
It was really quite pleasant.

01:07:07.916 --> 01:07:10.347 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I offered to make
some coffee.

01:07:10.541 --> 01:07:16.943 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Suddenly, the tallest of them
grabbed the table and threw it over.

01:07:18.791 --> 01:07:20.748 line:85% position:50% size:80%
They were done in five minutes.

01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:22.186 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Weren't you scared?

01:07:23.625 --> 01:07:27.480 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
No. I'm living on
borrowed time.

01:07:29.833 --> 01:07:35.077 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
The surgery was to give me
three years. It's been twelve.

01:07:36.041 --> 01:07:40.286 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
If God gave me life,
I have nothing to fear.

01:07:41.166 --> 01:07:43.572 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I was scared. For a moment.

01:07:44.166 --> 01:07:47.748 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I didn't know it can get that bad.

01:07:47.833 --> 01:07:50.081 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I have nothing else to be scared of.

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:51.300 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Good for you.

01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:56.668 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- I have no one to worry about me.
- Same here.

01:07:57.291 --> 01:08:04.179 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
My parents and my husband are dead.
There's no one left to worry about.

01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:10.751 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You really think it was God
who saved your life?

01:08:12.166 --> 01:08:14.630 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Who else could have?

01:08:17.417 --> 01:08:23.371 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Trust me, He can come to you
if you do what He expects.

01:08:24.332 --> 01:08:27.484 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
If you help others,
He may come.

01:08:28.582 --> 01:08:33.375 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Or try and invite Him yourself.
He'll understand.

01:08:40.957 --> 01:08:44.792 line:85% position:50% size:80%
They asked Mother Teresa

01:08:45.832 --> 01:08:49.974 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
what can you give a man
half an hour before his death?

01:08:51.582 --> 01:08:54.497 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
The faith that he's not
alone, she said.

01:08:56.375 --> 01:08:58.359 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I was alone for a while

01:08:58.542 --> 01:09:01.322 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
but you came
and I'm not any more.

01:09:02.625 --> 01:09:04.314 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'm glad you came.

01:09:40.125 --> 01:09:41.949 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Are you looking for someone?

01:09:54.542 --> 01:09:56.537 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Witek, you're being followed.

01:09:57.792 --> 01:09:58.891 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Am I?

01:10:00.957 --> 01:10:02.270 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Not possible.

01:10:03.167 --> 01:10:05.747 line:85% position:50% size:80%

</i><i>till the hangman hears the last I pick.</i>

01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:59.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
<i>I detest it when a crackling noise
</i><i>can be heard when I try to make a call.</i>

01:10:59.375 --> 01:11:04.037 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
<i>Shots in the back of someone's head
</i><i>are an abomination to me.</i>

01:11:04.292 --> 01:11:08.744 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
<i>I hate myself when I flinch,
</i><i>trying to excuse mean acts on my part,</i>

01:11:09.082 --> 01:11:13.664 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%

</i><i>though I despise them with all my heart.</i>

01:11:13.984 --> 01:11:18.819 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
<i>Smile ingratiatingly at those I serve
</i><i>though I despise them with all my heart.</i>

01:11:21.542 --> 01:11:24.014 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
See you. To your right, OK?
You go left.

01:11:25.875 --> 01:11:28.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Wait a moment...
OK, to your right.

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:30.327 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- See you in two weeks.
- Good!

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:35.046 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Can I buy your record?

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:36.845 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Sure. Over here.

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Two please.
- Out and to your left.

01:11:45.582 --> 01:11:46.744 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Daniel?

01:11:47.832 --> 01:11:50.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You don't recognize me?
To your right.

01:11:54.332 --> 01:11:55.524 line:85% position:50% size:80%
It's Witek!

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Summer of 1968. You were
leaving for Denmark.

01:12:00.707 --> 01:12:01.807 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Witek!

01:12:03.332 --> 01:12:04.516 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Hi!

01:12:06.707 --> 01:12:08.307 line:85% position:50% size:80%
My sister Wera.

01:12:09.662 --> 01:12:12.163 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- You're back for good?
- No, just a few days.

01:12:12.248 --> 01:12:14.121 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Our mother passed away.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.400 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Relax. I'll check.

01:12:18.998 --> 01:12:20.109 line:85% position:50% size:80%
We'll stay, huh?

01:12:25.630 --> 01:12:27.207 line:85% position:50% size:80%
It's my apartment.

01:12:27.292 --> 01:12:32.039 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
If you do it again, I'll inform
the authorities.

01:12:36.582 --> 01:12:37.699 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Cigarette?

01:12:39.167 --> 01:12:42.250 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- My aunt wants to call the police.
- Why?

01:12:43.207 --> 01:12:45.914 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
She's a pre-war communist,
a governor's widow.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.715 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
When we moved in
we had doors walled up,

01:12:51.332 --> 01:12:55.362 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
so it's a bit of a patchwork,
with stairs to the kitchen.

01:12:55.765 --> 01:12:56.832 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Will she call them?

01:12:56.917 --> 01:13:00.664 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
No, she's a good woman.
She thinks I'm being spiteful.

01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:04.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
And when she's really mad,
she addresses me as "comrade".

01:13:04.332 --> 01:13:08.118 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- What are you smoking?
- "Sports". First thing I bought.

01:13:11.917 --> 01:13:15.719 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
She divorced our father
before we left and lived alone.

01:13:16.792 --> 01:13:19.717 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Her neighbors were alarmed
by bottles of milk

01:13:19.802 --> 01:13:23.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
lined up on the doorstep
and discovered that she died.

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:26.270 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
How's your father?
I only saw him briefly.

01:13:27.292 --> 01:13:29.788 line:85% position:50% size:80%
He builds highways in Denmark.

01:13:29.917 --> 01:13:32.140 line:85% position:50% size:80%
We have a house and all.

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:35.747 line:85% position:50% size:80%
He got used to it, I can't.

01:13:35.832 --> 01:13:39.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Can't get over the feeling
that I'm some place distant.

01:13:42.957 --> 01:13:44.599 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What does it mean?

01:13:45.542 --> 01:13:50.279 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
"I'm happy in this happy little
country." In Danish.

01:13:52.042 --> 01:13:53.895 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Why didn't you
go with them?

01:13:55.375 --> 01:13:58.064 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- I didn't want to.
- She fell in love.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.904 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Really?
- Yes.

01:14:01.625 --> 01:14:07.073 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It was 1968. Someone yelled
"Jews go to Israel!" at her.

01:14:08.568 --> 01:14:11.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
A young man ran up
and punched that shouter in the face.

01:14:11.685 --> 01:14:15.685 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
She fell for him then and there.
He got expelled from the university

01:14:15.957 --> 01:14:21.095 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
and she ended up marrying him.
He's an aircraft engineer.

01:14:23.082 --> 01:14:26.649 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Back then, I had no idea
why you had to leave.

01:14:28.457 --> 01:14:31.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- How old were you, Wera?
- Eighteen.

01:14:32.207 --> 01:14:35.207 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- And we were...?
- Twelve.

01:14:38.582 --> 01:14:41.756 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I remember us saying goodbye.

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:48.645 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Your father called you
to follow him uphill, to the car.

01:14:49.207 --> 01:14:50.694 line:85% position:50% size:80%
There was no car.

01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:45.230 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Will you come back to Łódź?
- Yes, I will. Soon.

01:15:47.207 --> 01:15:48.336 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Look for me.

01:16:25.375 --> 01:16:27.332 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You're here for a reason?

01:16:27.417 --> 01:16:29.341 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- To get baptized.
- What?

01:16:33.707 --> 01:16:35.414 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'd like to get baptized.

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:38.185 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Are you nuts?
Whatever for?

01:16:38.792 --> 01:16:40.842 line:85% position:50% size:80%
So I know what to live for.

01:16:41.332 --> 01:16:44.715 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It brings reassurance
and peace of mind to so many people.

01:16:46.667 --> 01:16:48.105 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You, for example.

01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:51.845 line:85% position:50% size:80%
True. But you also need faith.

01:16:52.210 --> 01:16:54.476 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I think I've it because
I know what to do.

01:16:54.561 --> 01:16:57.774 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I want to voice my objections
instead of being passive.

01:16:58.167 --> 01:17:01.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Then join the Party.
- I won't find enlightenment there.

01:17:06.625 --> 01:17:07.809 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Do you pray?

01:17:08.917 --> 01:17:10.029 line:85% position:50% size:80%
No.

01:17:12.457 --> 01:17:14.796 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Try it sometime.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.180 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Oh Lord!

01:17:33.332 --> 01:17:36.579 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It's done.
I've been baptized.

01:17:39.125 --> 01:17:40.296 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Here I am.

01:17:43.167 --> 01:17:45.417 line:85% position:50% size:80%
All the formalities are behind me.

01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:53.395 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And now I ask you... to be.

01:17:55.207 --> 01:17:57.497 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'm ready, I'm baptized.

01:17:57.792 --> 01:18:00.001 line:85% position:50% size:80%
So please, don't fail to be.

01:18:01.457 --> 01:18:05.068 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I can't back out now.

01:18:05.332 --> 01:18:08.908 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I promise to never bother you again.

01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:12.969 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Just be.

01:18:16.207 --> 01:18:17.355 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Oh Lord...

01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:26.262 line:85% position:50% size:80%
998...

01:18:30.417 --> 01:18:31.565 line:85% position:50% size:80%
999...

01:18:37.582 --> 01:18:38.756 line:85% position:50% size:80%
1000.

01:18:39.332 --> 01:18:40.724 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Time for eggs!

01:18:43.082 --> 01:18:44.940 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- How many do you want?
- Two.

01:18:46.332 --> 01:18:47.432 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Shorty!

01:18:51.417 --> 01:18:53.224 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Change of shift, wake up!

01:18:56.417 --> 01:18:58.961 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- How many eggs you want?
- Three, please.

01:18:59.125 --> 01:19:00.427 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Or make it two.

01:19:16.137 --> 01:19:17.238 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Quiet!

01:19:18.417 --> 01:19:19.762 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:26.449 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Got anything for me to take?
- We do, two thousand copies.

01:19:32.542 --> 01:19:33.720 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Hi!
- Hi.

01:19:37.667 --> 01:19:40.373 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You haven't met? Shorty,
introduce yourself.

01:19:42.061 --> 01:19:45.055 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Staszek is the son of my Dean
at the Medical Academy.

01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:46.130 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Marek.

01:19:46.542 --> 01:19:49.456 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I brought you something to read.

01:19:52.417 --> 01:19:55.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- How about something normal to eat?
- I got eggs.

01:19:56.332 --> 01:19:57.478 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Gee...

01:19:58.832 --> 01:19:59.969 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What is that?

01:20:00.332 --> 01:20:02.680 line:85% position:50% size:80%
The Polish Independence Agreement.

01:20:13.167 --> 01:20:17.408 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Here's your passport. Got a visa?
- Yes. And a flight reservation.

01:20:19.042 --> 01:20:21.846 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What's the purpose of your trip?

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:26.515 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
A Catholic youth rally outside Paris.
An international event.

01:20:26.875 --> 01:20:30.287 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Your passport is ready, but it's not
as simple as that.

01:20:30.707 --> 01:20:32.920 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You were in contact
with various people,

01:20:33.005 --> 01:20:35.912 line:85% position:50% size:80%
got arrested for illegal prints,

01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:41.240 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- organized meetings at your apartment...
- I only made it available.

01:20:42.457 --> 01:20:43.578 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Never mind.

01:20:44.332 --> 01:20:47.819 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
We don't want you
to tell on your friends.

01:20:48.292 --> 01:20:49.501 line:85% position:50% size:80%
We know enough.

01:20:50.582 --> 01:20:55.454 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
But you'll meet
new people in France

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.567 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
and we want to know
who they are.

01:20:59.332 --> 01:21:01.070 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And what's going on.

01:21:01.582 --> 01:21:05.194 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
We'll provide a phone number
and you'll call with the names.

01:21:07.042 --> 01:21:13.010 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
We can even narrow it down
to French citizens.

01:21:13.582 --> 01:21:15.042 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And if I agree?

01:21:17.292 --> 01:21:19.252 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You'll get your passport.

01:21:39.542 --> 01:21:41.609 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Watch out.
He almost hit you.

01:21:55.957 --> 01:21:58.587 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I saved her from being run over.

01:21:58.957 --> 01:22:00.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- I hadn't noticed.
- Come.

01:22:08.082 --> 01:22:09.974 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What a strange day.

01:22:12.417 --> 01:22:13.894 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Unlike any other.

01:22:15.292 --> 01:22:16.550 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Why?

01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:18.703 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I visited my mother.

01:22:20.792 --> 01:22:21.891 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And?

01:22:22.832 --> 01:22:26.195 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Nothing. I visited her grave.
I have a grave to visit now.

01:22:26.457 --> 01:22:29.511 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Like everybody else.

01:22:31.457 --> 01:22:33.332 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I didn't have one before.

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:36.387 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I came from nowhere.

01:22:36.625 --> 01:22:39.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You don't understand
what it's like, do you?

01:22:40.207 --> 01:22:42.529 line:85% position:50% size:80%
It's all in your imagination.

01:22:43.875 --> 01:22:44.988 line:85% position:50% size:80%
No.

01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:50.317 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You must have had
a grandpa, a grandma...

01:22:51.167 --> 01:22:54.197 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Everyone has them.
You must have ancestors.

01:22:54.875 --> 01:22:56.524 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I know nothing about them.

01:22:58.369 --> 01:23:03.572 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
My mother never told me.
Then it was too late to ask.

01:23:05.210 --> 01:23:07.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I don't know who they were,
where they are.

01:23:07.824 --> 01:23:09.150 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I know nothing.

01:23:09.417 --> 01:23:13.518 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Two of my great-grandfathers
fought in the 1863 uprising.

01:23:14.667 --> 01:23:18.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
One grandfather fought
the Soviets in 1920.

01:23:19.417 --> 01:23:22.103 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Father fought in 1939,

01:23:22.375 --> 01:23:25.956 line:85% position:50% size:80%
and in workers' protests in 1956...

01:23:27.707 --> 01:23:29.934 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
He died in his bed
three years ago.

01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:32.557 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You have them all close by.

01:23:34.582 --> 01:23:36.153 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I never thought of that.

01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:40.664 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
What did your father tell you
when he was dying?

01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:42.288 line:85% position:50% size:80%
How do you know?

01:23:44.409 --> 01:23:49.869 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
He wanted to tell me something
but kept putting it off.

01:23:51.042 --> 01:23:54.957 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I would call him repeatedly
to make sure he was alive.

01:23:55.042 --> 01:24:01.457 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
He'd been dying for months.
I'd hang up when he answered.

01:24:01.984 --> 01:24:04.225 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
So as not to constantly ask
how he was.

01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:06.918 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
He knew it was me
and why I was calling.

01:24:08.457 --> 01:24:09.703 line:85% position:50% size:80%
The tea is good.

01:24:10.875 --> 01:24:13.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
In my fourth year,
during an autopsy,

01:24:13.375 --> 01:24:16.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
a student had a funny look
on her face.

01:24:17.917 --> 01:24:20.470 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
They were cutting
up her teacher.

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:22.220 line:85% position:50% size:80%
One she hated.

01:24:24.332 --> 01:24:29.163 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
She told me she fantasized
about doing it herself.

01:24:33.457 --> 01:24:35.243 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Why am I telling you this?

01:24:35.625 --> 01:24:39.113 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Because I told you the plot
of the movie "Manhattan".

01:24:45.125 --> 01:24:50.378 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
We've been talking for so long
there must be nothing left to say.

01:24:52.125 --> 01:24:53.320 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I don't think so.

01:24:54.957 --> 01:24:57.945 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
There are many things
you can't tell anyone.

01:25:00.207 --> 01:25:02.006 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You have such things?

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:04.622 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I do.

01:25:05.875 --> 01:25:07.957 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And you wouldn't tell me?

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:09.693 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I wouldn't.

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:15.810 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- About fear?
- Yes.

01:25:16.042 --> 01:25:17.177 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What else?

01:25:20.707 --> 01:25:23.233 line:85% position:50% size:80%
A few things about my father...

01:25:23.653 --> 01:25:24.756 line:85% position:50% size:80%
About God...

01:25:24.841 --> 01:25:26.103 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- God?
- God.

01:25:28.667 --> 01:25:30.355 line:85% position:50% size:80%
About my crooked toe...

01:25:33.832 --> 01:25:37.095 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
And there's something
I wouldn't know how to tell you.

01:25:38.332 --> 01:25:40.229 line:85% position:50% size:80%
But you would like to or not?

01:25:40.362 --> 01:25:44.889 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I couldn't. Something about you,
and perhaps about me.

01:25:50.957 --> 01:25:52.243 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You're sleepy?

01:25:54.832 --> 01:25:55.949 line:85% position:50% size:80%
No.

01:25:57.336 --> 01:25:59.274 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Get up, I'll show you something.

01:25:59.917 --> 01:26:02.177 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- I'm cold.
- Just a moment.

01:26:10.417 --> 01:26:11.564 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Found it.

01:26:12.042 --> 01:26:14.032 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Is this what we came to see?

01:26:18.582 --> 01:26:20.384 line:85% position:50% size:80%
There was a note inside.

01:26:20.667 --> 01:26:24.867 line:85% position:50% size:80%
From the past, about the future.

01:26:26.625 --> 01:26:29.393 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
And how it all turned out.
But it's gone now.

01:26:30.625 --> 01:26:32.354 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You were to go to France.

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:35.783 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I won't. I didn't get
the passport.

01:26:35.917 --> 01:26:39.083 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It was to be my first
international flight.

01:26:39.667 --> 01:26:43.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
My husband works on
international flights. I always...

01:26:44.917 --> 01:26:46.573 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You told me before.

01:26:48.792 --> 01:26:51.354 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You didn't want
to sleep with me...

01:26:52.082 --> 01:26:53.213 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I did.

01:27:30.875 --> 01:27:33.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Do you believe in God?
- I do.

01:27:37.042 --> 01:27:39.338 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Really?
- Yes.

01:27:45.167 --> 01:27:47.671 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Were you baptized?
- Recently.

01:27:52.082 --> 01:27:53.292 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What's it like?

01:27:54.082 --> 01:27:57.822 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
The priest asks if you want to
accept the Catholic faith.

01:27:59.832 --> 01:28:01.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- And what do you say?
- That I do.

01:28:17.832 --> 01:28:18.935 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Witek!

01:28:20.375 --> 01:28:21.528 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Witek!

01:30:32.207 --> 01:30:33.409 line:85% position:50% size:80%
A giveaway?

01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:36.317 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Where were you?

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:38.813 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Where are the guys?

01:30:41.332 --> 01:30:42.480 line:85% position:50% size:80%
In jail.

01:30:48.832 --> 01:30:52.177 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You were supposed to be here.
Where were you?

01:30:53.582 --> 01:30:55.162 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Are you suspecting me?

01:30:55.417 --> 01:30:56.555 line:85% position:50% size:80%
The key.

01:31:01.792 --> 01:31:04.457 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- And don't ever come here again.
- Man... Fuck!

01:31:04.542 --> 01:31:05.775 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Get the fuck out!

01:31:20.917 --> 01:31:22.462 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
No, I won't!
Don't you get it?

01:31:22.548 --> 01:31:25.497 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Then wait. Things will
clear up.

01:31:25.667 --> 01:31:26.676 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What about me?

01:31:26.761 --> 01:31:33.329 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Pray, so that you won't come
to hate those who accused you.

01:31:36.207 --> 01:31:39.452 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
And always remember
that this is a conspiracy.

01:31:41.292 --> 01:31:43.134 line:85% position:50% size:80%
The responsibility is twofold.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Suspicion is hard
to shake off.

01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:57.252 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You'll come to France with us.
We'll have plenty of time there.

01:32:04.707 --> 01:32:07.341 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- You will calm down.
- I'm not going.

01:32:16.375 --> 01:32:17.981 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Excuse me,
northbound buses?

01:32:18.127 --> 01:32:20.185 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Over there.
- Thank you.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:40.935 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Yes?

01:32:42.332 --> 01:32:45.216 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Is Wera home?
- No, she's not.

01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:48.868 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- When will she be back?
- I don't know.

01:32:49.125 --> 01:32:51.087 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'm a friend of her brother's.

01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:54.274 line:85% position:50% size:80%
She went to Łódź.

01:33:28.625 --> 01:33:34.569 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I came to see you but you
weren't here. Waited four hours, Wera.

01:33:43.957 --> 01:33:45.902 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Did you hear?
- Hear what?

01:33:46.332 --> 01:33:47.554 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Wait.

01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:53.923 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
That girl who stayed with you
for a few days. Was she Jewish?

01:33:54.332 --> 01:33:55.442 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Yes.

01:33:55.957 --> 01:33:59.064 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Many Jews were
great communists.

01:34:00.167 --> 01:34:01.338 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I know.

01:34:02.042 --> 01:34:03.905 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What are you listening to?

01:34:04.082 --> 01:34:05.207 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Free Europe.

01:34:05.293 --> 01:34:08.751 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
<i>Today, strikes began
</i><i>in a number of Polish cities.</i>

01:34:11.948 --> 01:34:15.636 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It's a good thing you haven't
left the country right now.

01:34:18.871 --> 01:34:23.088 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
<i>The train to Warsaw East Station
</i><i>will depart from Platform 2.</i>

01:34:27.917 --> 01:34:28.957 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Are you blind?

01:34:29.042 --> 01:34:31.434 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- You'll break your neck!
- Sorry!

01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:34.025 line:85% position:50% size:80%
He spilled my change.

01:34:35.457 --> 01:34:36.641 line:85% position:50% size:80%
A beer, please.

01:34:41.582 --> 01:34:43.650 line:85% position:50% size:80%
A student ticket to Warsaw.

01:34:47.752 --> 01:34:48.853 line:85% position:50% size:80%
One to Łomża.

01:35:44.207 --> 01:35:45.770 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What are you doing here?

01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:50.074 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I called you. Your aunt said
you were leaving.

01:35:50.832 --> 01:35:55.046 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- I wanted to see you off.
- I missed it by five seconds.

01:35:56.625 --> 01:35:59.190 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I looked for you after the funeral.

01:36:09.667 --> 01:36:13.863 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Remember our first time? On the floor
in the Students' Union room.

01:37:19.375 --> 01:37:21.619 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I won't be signing
anything now.

01:37:25.957 --> 01:37:30.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Leave your credit books
in my office. I have to go.

01:37:41.917 --> 01:37:43.283 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You're here to see me?

01:37:45.167 --> 01:37:47.679 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Yes. I just don't know
how to begin.

01:37:48.167 --> 01:37:49.421 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'm listening.

01:37:50.207 --> 01:37:52.158 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You approved my
Dean's leave.

01:37:53.417 --> 01:37:57.094 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Yes, I remember.
Is there something wrong?

01:37:58.042 --> 01:38:01.810 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I'd like to come back.
I'll catch up.

01:38:02.332 --> 01:38:04.548 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I thought about it and...

01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:07.182 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You said you lost your calling.

01:38:07.375 --> 01:38:09.070 line:85% position:50% size:80%
It came back.

01:38:10.917 --> 01:38:12.926 line:85% position:50% size:80%
It doesn't show, I'm afraid.

01:38:13.792 --> 01:38:14.983 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Although...

01:38:26.917 --> 01:38:28.033 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Yes?

01:38:28.167 --> 01:38:30.292 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I have to tell you something.

01:38:31.042 --> 01:38:32.153 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Yes?

01:38:33.707 --> 01:38:35.478 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'm three months pregnant.

01:38:55.917 --> 01:39:00.270 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%

01:40:00.707 --> 01:40:02.789 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I've been almost too lucky lately.

01:40:03.125 --> 01:40:05.605 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Does it worry you?
- No.

01:41:39.250 --> 01:41:43.115 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Here are the prescriptions.
- Can't she be placed somewhere?

01:41:44.292 --> 01:41:47.180 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I'll bring the medicines.
Come with me, please.

01:41:53.375 --> 01:41:58.225 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I'll come by every few days.
Just don't give her up, OK?

01:41:58.582 --> 01:42:01.438 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It won't be long now.
A month or two.

01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:04.948 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What are they doing?

01:42:05.917 --> 01:42:08.769 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Practicing. They have been
for ten years now.

01:42:14.292 --> 01:42:15.579 line:85% position:50% size:80%
What for?

01:42:15.917 --> 01:42:20.729 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Nothing. They say no one else
can throw so many balls at once.

01:42:40.625 --> 01:42:43.664 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Who talked to you?
- The first secretary.

01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:46.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
And another guy,
I don't know him.

01:42:48.875 --> 01:42:52.082 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
They promised to give me
an assistant position

01:42:52.167 --> 01:42:53.912 line:85% position:50% size:80%
and to fast track my M.D.

01:42:54.417 --> 01:42:57.033 line:85% position:50% size:80%
They did, didn't they? And?

01:42:59.042 --> 01:43:01.806 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I don't want it. But how do I
tell them?

01:43:02.625 --> 01:43:05.354 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Do you believe in God?
- No.

01:43:06.863 --> 01:43:10.061 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
That doesn't matter.
Tell them that you do

01:43:10.146 --> 01:43:13.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
and that your worldview
couldn't accommodate both.

01:43:13.250 --> 01:43:15.271 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Yeah... They can't read my mind.

01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:20.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
When I had such visitors, I would say
I didn't believe in the Party.

01:43:21.417 --> 01:43:23.247 line:85% position:50% size:80%
But don't tell them that.

01:43:23.332 --> 01:43:24.970 line:85% position:50% size:80%
It always made them angry.

01:43:26.707 --> 01:43:29.042 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
But why won't you
accept their offer?

01:43:29.832 --> 01:43:31.042 line:85% position:50% size:80%
They're right.

01:43:31.957 --> 01:43:34.282 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Life is much easier
for Party members.

01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:37.105 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
What they're doing
is an abomination.

01:43:37.625 --> 01:43:38.802 line:85% position:50% size:80%
No. I don't want to.

01:43:42.792 --> 01:43:44.742 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You've got
milk whiskers.

01:44:07.457 --> 01:44:10.384 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- I hear you got an offer.
- How do you know?

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:13.927 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
From the hospital.
They say you refused.

01:44:24.792 --> 01:44:27.384 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You want me to sing it
every night in bed?

01:44:28.875 --> 01:44:31.851 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
We've been administering it
for a week.

01:44:32.417 --> 01:44:34.179 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Any improvement?

01:44:34.375 --> 01:44:36.943 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Here's his previous
ECG to compare.

01:44:40.375 --> 01:44:41.524 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Doctor...

01:44:43.875 --> 01:44:46.613 line:85% position:50% size:80%
The heart rate has slowed down...

01:44:47.332 --> 01:44:49.992 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Yes?
- Can you spare a few minutes?

01:44:51.792 --> 01:44:52.962 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Excuse me.

01:44:55.367 --> 01:44:57.203 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Can you see the difference?

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.094 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Good morning.
- Hi. What is it?

01:45:11.417 --> 01:45:14.287 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
We're collecting signatures
from academics.

01:45:14.595 --> 01:45:15.706 line:85% position:50% size:80%
For what?

01:45:15.792 --> 01:45:17.899 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Students are given a hard time

01:45:17.984 --> 01:45:21.752 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
for distributing pamphlets
and for the Flying University.

01:45:22.582 --> 01:45:23.832 line:85% position:50% size:80%
This one. Who's he?

01:45:23.917 --> 01:45:27.390 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
They want to expel him.
For distribution.

01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:29.356 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- But who is he?
- Our Dean's son.

01:45:29.442 --> 01:45:31.730 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
That's why the Dean
didn't sign.

01:45:37.082 --> 01:45:39.997 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Rumor has it you refused
to join the Party.

01:45:40.082 --> 01:45:43.404 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- I did, but I won't sign this either.
- Why not?

01:45:44.250 --> 01:45:47.060 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I don't want to get involved
on either side.

01:45:47.832 --> 01:45:49.555 line:85% position:50% size:80%
It's only human to be scared.

01:45:50.028 --> 01:45:51.039 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'm not scared.

01:45:51.125 --> 01:45:54.664 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I'm a doctor because I want to
be accountable for what I do.

01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:56.268 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And to do it myself.

01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:02.900 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Fucker.

01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:48.641 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Hello?

01:47:49.667 --> 01:47:51.146 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Good evening, sir.

01:47:52.332 --> 01:47:53.664 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Don't worry about it.

01:47:55.167 --> 01:47:56.543 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Of course, no problem.

01:47:58.582 --> 01:48:01.625 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Train station? I'll be right there.

01:48:21.125 --> 01:48:24.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Thank you for coming.
I know it's late.

01:48:24.375 --> 01:48:25.582 line:85% position:50% size:80%
No problem, sir.

01:48:25.667 --> 01:48:28.119 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I want to ask a personal favor.

01:48:29.125 --> 01:48:31.520 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You know my son got arrested.

01:48:33.042 --> 01:48:36.769 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I'm going to Warsaw...
Anyway...

01:48:39.457 --> 01:48:43.603 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You see, I was to go
to Libya in about a month.

01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:46.497 line:85% position:50% size:80%
But now they won't let me.

01:48:46.582 --> 01:48:49.574 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- He went away for distributing leaflets?
- Yes.

01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:52.332 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I didn't sign the protest letter.

01:48:52.542 --> 01:48:55.556 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I know. Back then
I thought you were right.

01:48:58.332 --> 01:48:59.886 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Now I'm not so sure.

01:49:01.125 --> 01:49:03.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I couldn't.
I want to be impartial.

01:49:03.917 --> 01:49:08.109 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You're a decent man,
that's all that really matters.

01:49:10.167 --> 01:49:13.713 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I came to ask you
to replace me on that trip.

01:49:15.292 --> 01:49:19.713 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
You know my methods. It's just
a few consultations and lectures.

01:49:19.957 --> 01:49:21.787 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I have them written down.

01:49:24.082 --> 01:49:26.949 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- No need to answer today.
- I'll go, no problem.

01:49:27.332 --> 01:49:30.822 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Hear me out before
you say yes.

01:49:31.832 --> 01:49:35.712 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I can't think of anyone else
willing to help me out.

01:49:36.917 --> 01:49:39.253 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I probably won't be
Dean much longer.

01:49:39.692 --> 01:49:42.326 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
They'll probably remove me
from the Academy altogether.

01:49:42.411 --> 01:49:45.332 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I think they'll let you out
of the country

01:49:45.417 --> 01:49:49.636 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
but bear in mind it may be
your last trip for years to come.

01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:53.829 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I wanted you to know that
and to think about it.

01:49:55.625 --> 01:49:58.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
If you decide to go,
call me.

01:49:59.917 --> 01:50:02.927 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Otherwise just forget we met.

01:50:10.625 --> 01:50:13.090 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Sir, I've decided.
I'll go.

01:50:23.250 --> 01:50:27.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It happens to be
my wife's birthday

01:50:27.250 --> 01:50:31.667 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- so I'd like to reschedule if possible.
- I'll see what can be done.

01:50:32.250 --> 01:50:33.604 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I love her so much.

01:50:35.917 --> 01:50:39.278 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
There is a flight on the 11th,
via Paris.

01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:43.380 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
It's a foreign airline,
I'll check if you can fly with them.

01:50:51.582 --> 01:50:52.993 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I like your lighter.

01:50:53.582 --> 01:50:57.091 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Your ticket was purchased abroad
so there's no problem.

01:50:57.792 --> 01:51:03.038 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I'll check seat availability,
then change your ticket.

01:51:04.125 --> 01:51:06.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- When can I come back?
- In a couple of days.

01:51:06.832 --> 01:51:07.679 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Great.

01:51:27.207 --> 01:51:28.606 line:85% position:50% size:80%
We're cleaning up?

01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:31.000 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Go to bed.

01:51:31.582 --> 01:51:34.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
I'll empty the ashtrays
and tidy up a bit.

01:51:50.457 --> 01:51:53.257 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Will you see me off to Warsaw?
To the airport?

01:51:54.082 --> 01:51:55.694 line:85% position:50% size:80%
You know I'm on call.

01:51:59.375 --> 01:52:02.076 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Don't go.
- You mean it?

01:52:03.875 --> 01:52:06.150 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- No.
- My mind's made up.

01:52:06.375 --> 01:52:07.512 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I want to go.

01:52:13.667 --> 01:52:15.896 line:85% position:50% size:80%
I was watching you one night...

01:52:18.042 --> 01:52:19.149 line:85% position:50% size:80%
And?

01:52:20.114 --> 01:52:21.310 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Nothing.

01:52:49.850 --> 01:52:52.644 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Write to tell me what you thought
when you heard this.

01:52:52.729 --> 01:52:53.747 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Heard what?

01:52:53.889 --> 01:52:55.832 line:85% position:50% size:80%
We're going to have a daughter.

01:52:56.792 --> 01:52:57.957 line:85% position:50% size:80%
A daughter?

01:53:29.417 --> 01:53:31.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
- Do you have a light?
- Sure.

01:53:35.207 --> 01:53:36.367 line:85% position:50% size:80%
Thank you.
